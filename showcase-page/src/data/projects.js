    teaser: "Kids like mazes! So I created a maze generator in case the mood goes bad on long train rides.",
    description: "For this project, I used vanilla JavaScript â€” my first time experimenting with a class-based approach. I also worked on improving my test automation skills by diving into Vitest. To make it useful even when you're offline during your trips, I turned it into a Progressive Web App with offline functionality.",

    description: "One of my biggest Projects so far. I was not only checking out how to establish a frontend and a backend architecture with React and express.js. It was also my first time building a docker image and deploying it to google cloud run. Further I used two differt APIs to fetch trainline data and enhance it with spatial information from open street map. Since rate limits were strict I had to build update services and a spatial index to speed up client calls. I ended up adding zum LLM-magic to create texts based on structured data.",

    description: "I used this project for a first deep dive into React - and I loved it! On my learning path I improved my skills on ES6 functionality since my Javascript knowledge was basically still on a level I learned ten years before. To get the data the project was build on top of I discovered the wikimedia api. I used python scripts to fetch text information as well as beautiful pictures from this endpoint - doing some licence checks on the way. If you are interested, feel free to see my codebase in the repository or enjoy the game!",
